abstract: Contagion effect refers to the causal effect of peer behavior on the outcome
  of an individual in social networks. Contagion can be hard to estimate when it is
  confounded by latent homophily because nodes in a homophilic network tend to have
  ties to peers with similar attributes and can behave similarly without influencing
  one another. One way to account for latent homophily is by considering proxies for
  the unobserved confounders. However, as we demonstrate in this paper, existing proxy-based
  methods for contagion effect estimation have a very high variance when the proxies
  are high-dimensional. To address this issue, we introduce a novel framework, Proximal
  Embeddings (ProEmb), that integrates variational autoencoders with adversarial networks
  to create low-dimensional representations of high-dimensional proxies and help with
  estimating contagion effects. While VAEs have been used previously for representation
  learning in causal inference, a novel aspect of our approach is the additional component
  of adversarial networks to balance the representations of different treatment groups,
  which is essential in causal inference from observational data where these groups
  typically come from different distributions. We empirically show that our method
  significantly increases the accuracy and reduces the variance of contagion effect
  estimation in observational network data compared to state-of-the-art methods. We
  also demonstrate its applicability to two real-world scenarios, estimating contagion
  on social media and in adolescent smoking behavior.
