abstract: A key question in many network studies is whether the observed correlations
  between units are primarily due to contagion  or latent confounding. Here, we study
  this question using a segregated graph (Shpitser, 2015) representation of these
  mechanisms, and examine how uncertainty about the true underlying mechanism impacts
  downstream computation of network causal effects, particularly under full interference—settings
  where we only have a single realization of a network and each unit may depend on
  any other unit in the network. Under certain assumptions about asymptotic growth
  of the network,  we derive likelihood ratio tests that can be used to identify whether
  different sets of variables—confounders, treatments, and outcomes—across units exhibit
  dependence due to contagion or latent confounding. We then propose network causal
  effect estimation strategies  that provide unbiased and consistent estimates if
  the dependence mechanisms are either known or correctly inferred using our proposed
  tests. Together, the proposed methods allow network effect estimation in a wider
  range of full interference scenarios that have not been considered in prior work.
  We evaluate the effectiveness of our methods with synthetic data and the validity
  of our assumptions using real-world networks.
