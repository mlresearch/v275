abstract: The discovery of causal interactions from time series data is an increasingly
  common approach in science and engineering. Many of the approaches for solving it
  rely on an information-theoretic measure called transfer entropy [TE] to infer directed
  causal interactions. However, TE is difficult to estimate from empirical data, as
  non-parametric methods are hindered by the curse of dimensionality, while existing
  ML methods suffer from slow convergence or overfitting.  In this work, we introduce
  AGM-TE, a novel ML method that estimates TE using the difference in the predictive
  capabilities of two alternative probabilistic forecasting models. In a comprehensive
  suite of TE estimation benchmarks [with 100+ tasks], AGM-TE achieves SoTA results
  in terms of accuracy and data efficiency when compared to existing non-parametric
  and ML estimators. AGM-TE further differentiates itself with the ability to estimate
  conditional transfer entropy, which helps mitigate the effect of confounding variables
  in systems with many interacting components. We demonstrate the strengths of our
  approach empirically by recovering patterns of brain connectivity from 250+ dimensional
  spike data that are consistent with known neuroanatomical results.  Overall, we
  believe AGM-TE represents a significant step forward in the application of transfer
  entropy to problems of causal discovery from observational time series data.
