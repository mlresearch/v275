abstract: Controlling false positives (Type I errors) through statistical hypothesis
  testing is a foundation of modern scientific data analysis. Existing causal structure
  discovery algorithms either do not provide Type I error control or cannot scale
  to the size of modern scientific datasets. We consider a variant of the causal discovery
  problem with two sets of nodes, where the only edges of interest form a bipartite
  causal subgraph between the sets. We develop Scalable Causal Structure Learning
  (SCSL), a method for causal structure discovery on bipartite subgraphs that provides
  Type I error control. SCSL recasts the discovery problem as a simultaneous hypothesis
  testing problem and uses discrete optimization over the set of possible confounders
  to obtain an upper bound on the test statistic for each edge. Semi-synthetic simulations
  demonstrate that SCSL scales to handle graphs with hundreds of nodes while maintaining
  error control and good power. We demonstrate the practical applicability of the
  method by applying it to a cancer dataset to reveal connections between somatic
  gene mutations and metastases to different tissues.
