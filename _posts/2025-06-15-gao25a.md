abstract: 'It is crucial to be able to explain black-box prediction models to use
  them effectively and safely in practice. Most existing tools for model explanations
  are associational rather than causal, and we use two paradoxical examples to show
  that such explanations are generally inadequate. Motivated by the concept of genetic
  heritability in twin studies, we propose a new notion called counterfactual explainability
  for black-box prediction models. Counterfactual explainability has three key advantages:
  (1) it leverages counterfactual outcomes and extends methods for global sensitivity
  analysis (such as functional analysis of variance and Sobol’s indices) to a causal
  setting; (2) it is defined not only for the totality of a set of input factors but
  also for their interactions (indeed, it is a probability measure on a whole "explanation
  algebra’"); (3) it also applies to dependent input factors whose causal relationship
  can be modeled by a directed acyclic graph, thus incorporating causal mechanisms
  into the explanation.'
