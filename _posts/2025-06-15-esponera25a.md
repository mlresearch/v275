abstract: Causal abstraction techniques such as Interchange Intervention Training
  (IIT) have been proposed to infuse neural network with expert knowledge encoded
  in causal models, but their application to real-world problems remains limited.
  This article explores the application of IIT in predicting blood glucose levels
  in Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM) patients. The study utilizes an acyclic version
  of the simglucose simulator approved by the FDA to train a Multi-Layer Perceptron
  (MLP) model, employing IIT to impose causal relationships. Results show that the
  model trained with IIT effectively abstracted the causal structure and outperformed
  the standard one in terms of predictive performance across different prediction
  horizons (PHs) post-meal. Furthermore, the breakdown of the counterfactual loss
  can be leveraged to explain which part of the causal mechanism are more or less
  effectively captured by the model. These preliminary results suggest the potential
  of IIT in enhancing predictive models in healthcare by effectively complying with
  expert knowledge.
