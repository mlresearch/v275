abstract: 'Causal discovery from observational data holds great promise, but existing
  methods rely on strong assumptions about the underlying causal structure, often
  requiring full observability of all relevant variables. We tackle these challenges
  by leveraging the score function $\nabla \log p(X)$ of observed variables for causal
  discovery and propose the following contributions. First, we generalize the existing
  results of identifiability with the score to additive noise models with minimal
  requirements on the causal mechanisms. Second, we establish conditions for inferring
  causal relations from the score even in the presence of hidden variables; this result
  is two-faced: we demonstrate the score’s potential as an alternative to conditional
  independence tests to infer the equivalence class of causal graphs with hidden variables,
  and we provide the necessary conditions for identifying direct causes in latent
  variable models. Building on these insights, we propose a flexible algorithm for
  causal discovery across linear, nonlinear, and latent variable models, which we
  empirically validate.'
