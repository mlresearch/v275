abstract: Accurate estimates of causal effects play a key role in decision-making
  across applications such as healthcare, economics, and operations. In the absence
  of randomized experiments, a common approach to estimating causal effects uses covariate
  adjustment. In this paper, we study covariate adjustment for discrete distributions
  from the PAC learning perspective, assuming knowledge of a valid adjustment set
  $\mathbf{Z}$, which might be high-dimensional. Our first main result PAC-bounds
  the estimation error of covariate adjustment by a term that is exponential in the
  size of the adjustment set; it is known that such a dependency is unavoidable even
  if one only aims to minimize the mean squared error. Motivated by this result, we
  introduce the notion of an $\varepsilon$-Markov blanket, give bounds on the misspecification
  error of using such a set for covariate adjustment, and provide an algorithm for
  $\varepsilon$-Markov blanket discovery; our second main result upper bounds the
  sample complexity of this algorithm. Furthermore, we provide a misspecification
  error bound and a constraint-based algorithm that allow us to go beyond $\varepsilon$-Markov
  blankets to even smaller adjustment sets. Our third main result upper bounds the
  sample complexity of this algorithm, and our final result combines the first three
  into an overall PAC bound. Altogether, our results highlight that one does not need
  to perfectly recover causal structure in order to ensure accurate estimates of causal
  effects.
