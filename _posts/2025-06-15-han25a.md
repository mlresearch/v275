abstract: Methods of statistically testing the accuracy of causal graphical models
  have traditionally been limited, with most focusing on parametric global assessments
  of the entire causal graph. However, whether or not a causal graphical model passes
  a statistical test, it is crucial for many practical applications to find which
  parts of the graph are accurately reconstructed and which are not. In this paper,
  we introduce the Vertex Checker, the only statistical test that we are aware of
  that takes as input a causal graphical model G, a vertex X, and an alpha level,
  sample data, and a conditional independence test, and provides a non-parametric,
  asymptotically correct, statistical test of a local subgraph of X, is computationally
  feasible for dozens of variables, and is extendable to other kinds of causal graphical
  models. Through extensive simulations, we demonstrate the robustness of the Vertex
  Checker across various data types, causal graphs, and distributions both in terms
  of accuracy of graphical structure and of quantitative estimates of causal effects.
  Furthermore, we apply the Vertex Checker to the real-world Sachs dataset, showcasing
  its practical applicability in uncovering accurate substructures within causal graphs,
  even when the overall causal graphical model is rejected.
