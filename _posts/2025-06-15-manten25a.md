abstract: In this paper, we develop the theory linking directed mixed graphs (DMGs)
  with the graphical ’E-separation’-criterion to form asymmetric independence models
  that are closed under marginalization and which graphically describe the conditional
  independence relations among coordinate processes in stochastic differential equations
  (SDEs) when testing "which variables enter the governing equations of which other
  variables." Besides a global Markov property for cyclic SDEs, which naturally extends
  to latent, cyclic SDEs, we also characterize graphs, which encode the same set of
  independence relations and show that in the fully observed case, modelled by directed
  graphs, each class of graphs under this equivalence relation has a maximal element
  that is graphi- cally characterizable, analogous to the famous ’same skeleton and
  V-structure’ result for Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) and in addition is recoverable
  from data. Moreover, we conjecture that same holds true in the partially observed
  case and verify this empirically for graphs up to 4 nodes.
