abstract: Unraveling the co-expression of genes across studies enhances the understanding
  of cellular processes. Inferring gene co-expression networks from transcriptome
  data presents many challenges, including the high-dimensionality of the data relative
  to the number of samples, sample correlations, and batch effects. To address these
  complexities, we introduce a robust method for high-dimensional graph inference
  from multiple independent studies.  We base our approach on the premise that each
  dataset is essentially a noisy linear mixture of gene loadings that follow a multivariate
  $t$-distribution with a sparse precision matrix, which is shared across studies.
  This allows us to show that  we can identify the co-expression matrix up to a scaling
  factor among other model parameters. Our method employs an Expectation-Maximization
  procedure for parameter estimation. Empirical evaluation on synthetic and gene expression
  data demonstrates our method’s improved ability to learn the underlying graph structure
  compared to baseline methods.
