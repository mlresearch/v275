abstract: 'Assuming a directed acyclic graph (DAG) that represents prior knowledge
  of causal relationships between variables is a common starting point for cause-effect
  estimation. Existing literature typically invokes hypothetical domain expert knowledge
  or causal discovery algorithms to justify this assumption. In practice, neither
  may propose a single DAG with high confidence: domain experts are hesitant to rule
  out dependencies with certainty or have ongoing disputes about relationships, whereas
  causal discovery often only provides an equivalence class of DAGs, relies on untestable
  assumptions itself, or are sensitive to hyperparameter and threshold choices. We
  propose an efficient, gradient-based optimization method that provides bounds for
  causal queries over a collection of plausible causal graphs given prior knowledge
  that may still be too large for exhaustive enumeration. We demonstrate excellent
  coverage and sharpness of our bounds for causal queries such as average treatment
  effect estimation in linear and non-linear synthetic settings as well as on real-world
  data. Our approach is an easy-to-use and widely applicable rebuttal to the valid
  critique of ‘What if your assumed DAG is wrong?’.'
