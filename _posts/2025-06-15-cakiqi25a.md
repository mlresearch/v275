abstract: Causal identification in causal Bayes nets (CBNs) is an important tool in
  causal inference allowing the derivation of interventional distributions from observational
  distributions where this is possible in principle. However, most existing formulations
  of causal identification using techniques such as d-separation and do-calculus are
  expressed within the mathematical language of classical probability theory on CBNs.
  However, there are many causal settings where probability theory and hence current
  causal identification techniques are inapplicable such as relational databases,
  dataflow programs such as hardware description languages, distributed systems and
  most modern machine learning algorithms. We show that this restriction can be lifted
  by replacing the use of classical probability theory with the alternative axiomatic
  foundation of symmetric monoidal categories. In this alternative axiomatization,
  we show how an unambiguous and clean distinction can be drawn between the general
  syntax of causal models and any specific semantic implementation of that causal
  model. This allows a purely syntactic algorithmic description of general causal
  identification by a translation of recent formulations of the general ID algorithm
  through fixing. Our description is given entirely in terms of the non-parametric
  ADMG structure specifying a causal model and the algebraic signature of the corresponding
  monoidal category, to which a sequence of manipulations is then applied so as to
  arrive at a modified monoidal category in which the desired, purely syntactic interventional
  causal model, is obtained. We use this idea to derive purely syntactic analogues
  of classical back-door and front-door causal adjustment, and illustrate an application
  to a more complex causal model.
