abstract: Describing the causal relations governing a system is a fundamental task
  in many scientific fields, ideally addressed by experimental studies. However, obtaining
  data under intervention scenarios may not always be feasible, while discovering
  causal relations from purely observational data is notoriously challenging. In certain
  settings, such as genomics, we may have data from heterogeneous study conditions,
  with soft (partial) interventions only pertaining to a subset of the study variables,
  whose effects and targets are possibly unknown. Combining data from experimental
  and observational studies offers the opportunity to leverage both domains and improve
  the identifiability of causal structures. To this end, we define the interventional
  BGe score for a mixture of observational and interventional data for linear-Gaussian
  models, where the targets and effects of intervention may be unknown. Prerogative
  of our method is that it takes a Bayesian perspective leading to a full characterisation
  of the posterior distribution of the DAG structures. Given a sample of DAGs, one
  can also automatically derive full posterior distributions of the intervention effects.
  Consequently, the method effectively captures the uncertainty both in the structure
  and the parameter estimates. We additionally demonstrate the performance of the
  approach both in simulations and data analysis applications.  Codes to reproduce
  the simulations and analyses are publicly available at https://github.com/jackkuipers/iBGe.
