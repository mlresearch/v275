abstract: In (Beckers, 2025) I introduced nondeterministic causal models as a generalization
  of Pearlâ€™s standard deterministic causal models. I here take advantage of the increased
  expressivity offered by these models to offer a novel definition of actual causation
  (that also applies to deterministic models). Instead of motivating the definition
  by way of (often subjective) intuitions about examples, I proceed by developing
  it based entirely on the unique function that it can fulfil in communicating and
  learning a causal model. First I generalize the more basic notion of counterfactual
  dependence, second I show how this notion has a vital role to play in the logic
  of causal discovery, third I introduce the notion of a structural simplification
  of a causal model, and lastly I bring both notions together in my definition of
  actual causation. Although novel, the resulting definition arrives at verdicts that
  are almost identical to those of my previous definition (Beckers, 2021, 2022).
