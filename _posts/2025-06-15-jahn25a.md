abstract: In this paper, we analyze the applicability of the Causal Identification
  algorithm to causal time series graphs with latent confounders. Since these graphs
  extend over infinitely many time steps, deciding whether causal effects across arbitrary
  time intervals are identifiable appears to require computation on graph segments
  of unbounded size. Even for deciding the identifiability of intervention effects
  on variables that are close in time, no bound is known on how many time steps in
  the past need to be considered. We give a first bound of this kind that only depends
  on the number of variables per time step and the maximum time lag of any direct
  or latent causal effect. More generally, we show that applying the Causal Identification
  algorithm to a constant-size segment of the time series graph is sufficient to decide
  identifiability of causal effects, even across unbounded time intervals.
