abstract: I generalize acyclic deterministic structural causal models to the nondeterministic
  case and argue that this offers an improved semantics for counterfactuals. The standard,
  deterministic, semantics developed by Halpern (and based on the initial proposal
  of Galles & Pearl) assumes that for each assignment of values to parent variables
  there is a unique assignment to their child variable, and it assumes that the actual
  world (an assignment of values to all variables of a model) specifies a unique counterfactual
  world for each intervention. Both assumptions are unrealistic, and therefore I drop
  both of them in my proposal. I do so by allowing multi-valued functions in the structural
  equations. In addition, I adjust the semantics so that the solutions to the equations
  that obtained in the actual world are preserved in any counterfactual world. I provide
  a sound and complete axiomatization of the resulting logic and compare it to the
  standard one by Halpern and to more recent proposals that are closer to mine. Finally,
  I extend these models to the probabilistic case and show that they open up the way
  to identifying counterfactuals even in Causal Bayesian Networks.
