abstract: Resettlement agencies have started to adopt data-driven algorithmic matching
  to match refugees to locations using employment rate as a measure of utility. Given
  a pool of refugees, data-driven algorithmic matching utilizes a classifier to predict
  the probability that each refugee would find employment at any given location. Then,
  it uses the predicted probabilities to estimate the expected utility of all possible
  placement decisions. Finally, it finds the placement decisions that maximize the
  predicted utility by solving a maximum weight bipartite matching problem. In this
  work, we argue that, using existing solutions, there may be pools of refugees for
  which data-driven algorithmic matching is (counterfactually) harmfulâ€”it would have
  achieved lower utility than a given default policy used in the past, had it been
  used. Then, we develop a post-processing algorithm that, given placement decisions
  made by a default policy on a pool of refugees and the employment outcomes of the
  refugees in the pool, solves an inverse matching problem to minimally modify the
  predictions made by a given classifier. Under these modified predictions, the optimal
  matching policy that maximizes predicted utility on the pool is guaranteed to be
  not harmful. Further, we introduce a Transformer model that, given placement decisions
  made by a default policy on multiple pools of refugees and the employment outcomes
  of the refugees in these pools, learns to modify the predictions made by a given
  classifier so that the optimal matching policy that maximizes predicted utility
  under the modified predictions on an unseen pool of refugees is less likely to be
  harmful than under the original predictions. Experiments on simulated resettlement
  processes using synthetic refugee data created from a variety of publicly available
  data from international organizations, including the United Nations Refugee Agency
  (UNHCR), suggest that our methodology may be effective in making algorithmic placement
  decisions that are less likely to be harmful than existing solutions.
