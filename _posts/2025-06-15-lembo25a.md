abstract: Dynamic networks models describe temporal interactions between social actors,
  and as such have been used to describe financial fraudulent transactions, dispersion
  of destructive invasive species across the globe, and the spread of fake news. An
  important question in all of these examples is what are the causal drivers underlying
  these processes. Current network models are exclusively descriptive and based on
  correlative structures. In this paper we propose a causal extension of dynamic network
  modelling. In particular, we prove that the causal model satisfies a set of population
  conditions that uniquely identifies the causal drivers. The empirical analogue of
  these conditions provide a consistent causal discovery algorithm, which distinguishes
  it from other inferential approaches. Crucially, data from a single environment
  is sufficient. We apply the method in an analysis of bike sharing data in Washington
  D.C. in July 2023.
