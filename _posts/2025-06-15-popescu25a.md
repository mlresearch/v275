abstract: Conditional independence testing (CIT) is a common task in machine learning,
  e.g., for variable selection, and a main component of constraint-based causal discovery.
  While most current CIT approaches assume that all variables in a dataset are of
  the same type, either numerical or categorical, many real-world applications involve
  mixed-type datasets that include both numerical and categorical variables. Non-parametric
  CIT can be conducted using conditional mutual information (CMI) estimators combined
  with a local permutation scheme. Recently, two novel CMI estimators for mixed-type
  datasets based on k-nearest-neighbors (k-NN) have been proposed. As with any k-NN
  method, these estimators rely on the definition of a distance metric. One approach
  computes distances by a one-hot encoding of the categorical variables, essentially
  treating categorical variables as discrete-numerical, while the other expresses
  CMI by entropy terms where the categorical variables appear as conditions only.
  In this work, we study these estimators and propose a variation of the former approach
  that does not treat categorical variables as numeric. Our extensive numerical experiments
  show that our variant detects dependencies more robustly across different data distributions
  and preprocessing types.
