abstract: The Causal Effect (CE) is a numerical measure of causal influence of variables
  on observed results. Despite being widely used in many areas, only preliminary attempts
  have been made to use CE as an attribution score in data management, to measure
  the causal strength of tuples for query answering in databases. In this work, we
  introduce, generalize and investigate the so-called Causal-Effect Score in the context
  of classical and probabilistic databases.
