abstract: Earth Observation (EO) data are increasingly used in policy analysis by
  enabling granular estimation of conditional average treatment effects (CATE). However,
  a challenge in EO-based causal inference is determining the scale of the input satellite
  imagery—balancing the trade-off between capturing fine-grained individual heterogeneity
  in smaller images and broader contextual information in larger ones. This paper
  introduces Multi-Scale Representation Concatenation, a set of composable procedures
  that transform arbitrary single-scale EO-based CATE estimation algorithms into multi-scale
  ones. We benchmark the performance of Multi-Scale Representation Concatenation on
  a CATE estimation pipeline that combines Vision Transformer (ViT) models (which
  encode images) with Causal Forests (CFs) to obtain CATE estimates from those encodings.
  We first perform simulation studies where the causal mechanism is known, showing
  that our multi-scale approach captures information relevant to effect heterogeneity
  that single-scale ViT models fail to capture as measured by R-squared. We then apply
  the multi-scale method to two randomized controlled trials (RCTs) conducted in Peru
  and Uganda using Landsat satellite imagery. As we do not have access to ground truth
  CATEs in the RCT analysis, the Rank Average Treatment Effect Ratio (RATE Ratio)
  measure is employed to assess performance. Results indicate that Multi-Scale Representation
  Concatenation improves the performance of deep learning models in EO-based CATE
  estimation without the complexity of designing new multi-scale architectures for
  a specific use case. The application of Multi-Scale Representation Concatenation
  could have meaningful policy benefits—e.g., potentially increasing the impact of
  poverty alleviation programs without additional resource expenditure.
