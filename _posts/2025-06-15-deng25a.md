abstract: Transferring knowledge from one environment to another is an essential ability
  of intelligent systems. Nevertheless, when two environments are different, naively
  transferring all knowledge may deteriorate the performance, a phenomenon known as
  negative transfer. In this paper, we address this issue within the framework of
  multi-armed bandits from the perspective of causal inference. Specifically, we consider
  transfer learning in latent contextual bandits, where the actual context is hidden,
  but a potentially high-dimensional proxy is observable. We further consider a covariate
  shift in the context across environments. We show that naively transferring all
  knowledge for classical bandit algorithms in this setting led to negative transfer.
  We then leverage transportability theory from causal inference to develop algorithms
  that explicitly transfer effective knowledge for estimating the causal effects of
  interest in the target environment. Besides, we utilize variational autoencoders
  to approximate causal effects under the presence of a high-dimensional proxy. We
  test our algorithms on synthetic and semi-synthetic datasets, empirically demonstrating
  consistently improved learning efficiency across different proxies compared to baseline
  algorithms, showing the effectiveness of our causal framework in transferring knowledge.
