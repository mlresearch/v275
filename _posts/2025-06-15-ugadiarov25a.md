abstract: There have recently been significant advances in the problem of unsupervised
  object-centric representation learning and its application to downstream tasks.
  The latest works support the argument that employing disentangled object representations
  in image-based object-centric reinforcement learning tasks facilitates policy learning.
  We propose a novel object-centric reinforcement learning algorithm combining actor-critic
  and model-based approaches, by incorporating an object-centric world model in critic.
  The proposed method fills a research gap in developing efficient object-centric
  world models for reinforcement learning settings that can be used for environments
  with discrete or continuous action spaces. We evaluated our algorithm in simulated
  3D robotic environment and a 2D environment with compositional structure. As baselines,
  we consider the state-of-the-art model-free actor-critic algorithm built upon transformer
  architecture and the state-of-the-art monolithic model-based algorithm. While the
  proposed method demonstrates comparable performance to the baselines in easier tasks,
  it outperforms the baselines within the 1M environment step budget in more challenging
  tasks increased number of objects or more complex dynamics.
