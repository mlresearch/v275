abstract: Unmeasured confounding is a major challenge for identifying causal relationships
  from non-experimental data. Here, we propose a method that can accommodate unmeasured
  discrete confounding. Extending recent identifiability results in deep latent variable
  models, we show theoretically that confounding can be detected and corrected under
  the assumption that the observed data is a piecewise affine transformation of a
  latent Gaussian mixture model and that the identity of the mixture components is
  confounded. We provide a flow-based algorithm to estimate this model and perform
  deconfounding. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world data provide support
  for the effectiveness of our approach.
