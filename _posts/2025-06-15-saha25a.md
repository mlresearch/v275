abstract: Quantifying the causal influence of input features within neural networks
  has become a topic of increasing interest. Existing approaches typically assess
  direct, indirect, and total causal effects. This work treats NNs as structural causal
  models (SCMs) and extends our focus to include intrinsic causal contributions (ICC).
  We propose an identifiable generative post-hoc framework for quantifying ICC. We
  also draw a relationship between ICC and Sobolâ€™ indices. Our experiments on synthetic
  and real-world datasets demonstrate that ICC generates more intuitive and faithful
  explanations compared to existing global explanation techniques.
