abstract: Which set of features was responsible for a certain output of a machine
  learning model? Which components caused the failure of a cloud computing application?
  These are just two examples of questions we are addressing in this work by Identifying
  Coalition-based Explanations for Common and Rare Events in Any Model (ICECREAM).
  Specifically, we propose an information-theoretic quantitative measure for the influence
  of a coalition of variables on the distribution of a target variable. This allows
  us to identify which set of factors is essential to obtain a certain outcome, as
  opposed to well-established explainability and causal contribution analysis methods
  that rank individual factors. In experiments with synthetic and real-world data,
  we show that ICECREAM outperforms state-of-the-art methods for explainability and
  root cause analysis, and achieves impressive accuracy in both tasks.
