abstract: We study the causal bandit problem when the causal graph is unknown and
  develop an efficient algorithm for finding the parent node of the reward node using
  atomic interventions. We derive the exact equation for the expected number of interventions
  performed by the algorithm and show that under certain graphical conditions it could
  perform either logarithmically fast or, under more general assumptions, slower but
  still sublinearly in the number of variables. We formally show that our algorithm
  is optimal as it meets the universal lower bound we establish for any algorithm
  that performs atomic interventions. Finally, we extend our algorithm to the case
  when the reward node has multiple parents.  Using this algorithm together with a
  standard algorithm from bandit literature leads to improved regret bounds.
