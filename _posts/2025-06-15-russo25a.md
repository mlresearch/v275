abstract: Causal Structure Learning (CSL), also referred to as causal discovery, amounts
  to extracting causal relations among variables in data. CSL enables the estimation
  of causal effects from observational data alone, avoiding the need to perform real
  life experiments. Constraint-based CSL leverages conditional independence tests
  to perform causal discovery. We propose Shapley-PC, a novel method to improve constraint-based
  CSL algorithms by using Shapley values over the possible conditioning sets, to decide
  which variables are responsible for the observed conditional (in)dependences. We
  prove soundness, completeness and asymptotic consistency of Shapley-PC and run a
  simulation study showing that our proposed algorithm is superior to existing versions
  of PC.
