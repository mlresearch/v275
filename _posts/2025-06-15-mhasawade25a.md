abstract: The transport of mediation effects is an important question for upstream
  interventions, such as targeted development of parks to improve population health,
  as their effect on populations is mediated by factors like physical activity, which
  can vary from place to place. However, upstream treatment effect estimates could
  be biased when mediator variables are missing for the population where the effect
  is to be transported. We study this issue of the impact of missing mediators on
  transported effects, motivated by challenges in public health, wherein mediators
  are commonly missing but not at random. We propose a sensitivity analysis framework
  to quantify the impact of missing mediator data on transported mediation effects,
  identifying when the conditional transported mediation effect becomes insignificant
  for subgroups with missing data. Applied to longitudinal data from the Moving to
  Opportunity Study, a large-scale housing voucher experiment, this framework demonstrates
  the sensitivity of transported mediation effects to data missingness. In particular,
  we quantify the effect of missing mediators on transport effect estimates of voucher
  receipt in childhood, an upstream intervention on living location. We then assess
  the subsequent impact on the risk of mental health or substance use disorder mediated
  through parental health across sites. Our findings highlight that missing mediators
  can disparately impact effect estimates across population subgroups and provide
  a tangible understanding of how much missing data can be withstood for unbiased
  effect estimates in such mediated settings.
