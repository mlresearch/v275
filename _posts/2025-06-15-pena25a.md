abstract: We report distribution-free bounds for any contrast between the probabilities
  of the potential outcome under exposure and non-exposure when the confounders are
  missing not at random. We assume that the missingness mechanism is outcome-independent.
  We also report a sensitivity analysis method to complement our bounds.
