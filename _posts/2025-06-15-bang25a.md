abstract: In this paper we consider the use of tiered background knowledge within
  constraint based causal discovery. Our focus is on settings relaxing causal sufficiency,
  i.e. allowing for latent variables which may arise because relevant information
  could not be measured at all, or not jointly, as in the case of multiple overlapping
  datasets. We first present novel insights into the properties of the ’tiered FCI’
  (tFCI) algorithm. Building on this, we introduce a new extension of the IOD (integrating
  overlapping datasets) algorithm incorporating tiered background knowledge, the ’tiered
  IOD’ (tIOD) algorithm. We show that under full usage of the tiered background knowledge
  tFCI and tIOD are sound, while simple versions of the tIOD and tFCI are sound and
  complete. We further show that the tIOD algorithm can often be expected to be considerably
  more efficient and informative than the IOD algorithm even beyond the obvious restriction
  of the Markov equivalence classes. We provide a formal result on the conditions
  for this gain in efficiency and informativeness. Our results are accompanied by
  a series of examples illustrating the exact role and usefulness of tiered background
  knowledge.
