abstract: Many real-world systems can be usefully represented as sets of interacting
  components. Examples include computational systems, such as query processors and
  compilers; natural systems, such as cells and ecosystems; and social systems, such
  as families and organizations. However, current approaches to estimating *potential
  outcomes* and *causal effects* typically treat such systems as single units, represent
  them with a fixed set of variables, and assume a homogeneous data-generating process.
  In this work, we study a *compositional* approach for estimating individual-level
  potential outcomes and causal effects in structured systems, where each unit is
  represented by an *instance-specific* composition of multiple heterogeneous components.
  The compositional approach decomposes unit-level causal queries into more fine-grained
  queries, explicitly modeling how unit-level interventions affect component-level
  outcomes to generate a unitâ€™s outcome. We demonstrate this approach using modular
  neural network architectures and show that it provides benefits for causal effect
  estimation from observational data, such as accurate causal effect estimation for
  structured units, increased sample efficiency, improved overlap between treatment
  and control groups, and compositional generalization to units with unseen combinations
  of components. Remarkably, our results show that compositional modeling can improve
  the accuracy of causal estimation even when component-level outcomes are unobserved.
  We also create and use a set of real-world evaluation environments for the empirical
  evaluation of compositional approaches for causal effect estimation and demonstrate
  the role of composition structure, varying amounts of component-level data access,
  and component heterogeneity in the performance of compositional models as compared
  to the non-compositional approaches.
