abstract: Our work addresses a fundamental problem in the context of counterfactual
  inference for Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). Given an MDP path $\tau$, counterfactual
  inference allows us to derive counterfactual paths $\tauâ€™$ describing _what-if_
  versions of $\tau$ obtained under different action sequences than those observed
  in $\tau$. However, as the counterfactual states and actions deviate from the observed
  ones over time, _the observation $\tau$ may no longer influence the counterfactual
  world_, meaning that the analysis is no longer tailored to the individual observation,
  resulting in interventional outcomes rather than counterfactual ones. This issue
  specifically affects the popular Gumbel-max structural causal model used for MDP
  counterfactuals, and yet, it has remained overlooked until now. In this work, we
  introduce a formal characterisation of influence based on comparing counterfactual
  and interventional distributions. We devise an algorithm to construct counterfactual
  models that automatically satisfy influence constraints. Leveraging such models,
  we derive counterfactual policies that are not just optimal for a given reward structure
  but also remain tailored to the observed path. Even though there is an unavoidable
  trade-off between policy optimality and strength of influence constraints, our experiments
  demonstrate that it is possible to derive (near-)optimal policies while remaining
  under the influence of the observation.
