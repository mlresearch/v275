abstract: 'We propose a new approach to falsify causal discovery algorithms without
  ground truth, which is based on testing the causal model on a variable pair excluded
  during learning the causal model. Specifically, given data on $X, Y, \boldsymbol{Z}=X,
  Y, Z_1,…,Z_k$, we apply the causal discovery algorithm separately to the ’leave-one-out’
  data sets $X, \boldsymbol{Z}$ and $Y, \boldsymbol{Z}$. We demonstrate that the two
  resulting causal models, in the form DAGs, ADMGs, CPDAGs or PAGs, often entail conclusions
  on the dependencies between $X$ and $Y$ and allow to estimate $\mathbb{E}(Y\mid
  X=x)$ without any joint observations of $X$ and $Y$, given only the leave-one-out
  datasets. This estimation is called  "Leave-One-Variable-Out (LOVO)" prediction.
  Its error can be  estimated since the joint distribution $P(X, Y)$ is available,
  and $X$ and $Y$ have only been omitted for the purpose of falsification. We present
  two variants of LOVO prediction: One graphical method, which is applicable to general
  causal discovery algorithms, and one version tailored towards algorithms relying
  on specific a priori assumptions, such as linear additive noise models.  Simulations
  indicate that the LOVO prediction error is indeed correlated with the accuracy of
  the causal outputs, affirming the method’s effectiveness.'
