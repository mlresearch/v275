abstract: Causal discovery aims to extract qualitative causal knowledge in the form
  of causal graphs from data. Because causal ground truth is rarely known in the real
  world, simulated data plays a vital role in evaluating the performance of the various
  causal discovery algorithms proposed in the literature. But recent work highlighted
  certain artifacts of commonly used data generation techniques for a standard class
  of structural causal models (SCM) that may be nonphysical, including var- and R2-sortability,
  where the variablesâ€™ variance and coefficients of determination (R2) after regressing
  on all other variables, respectively, increase along the causal order. Some causal
  methods exploit such artifacts, leading to unrealistic expectations for their performance
  on real-world data. Some modifications have been proposed to remove these artifacts;
  notably, the internally-standardized structural causal model (iSCM) avoids varsortability
  and largely alleviates R2-sortability on sparse causal graphs, but exhibits a reversed
  R2-sortability pattern for denser graphs not featured in their work. We analyze
  which sortability patterns we expect to see in real data, and propose a method for
  drawing coefficients that we argue more effectively samples the space of SCMs. Finally,
  we propose a novel extension of our SCM generation method to the time series setting.
