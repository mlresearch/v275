abstract: We study the problem of closeness testing for continuous distributions and
  its implications for causal discovery. Specifically, we analyze the sample complexity
  of distinguishing whether two multidimensional continuous distributions are identical
  or differ by at least $\epsilon$ in terms of Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence under
  non-parametric assumptions. To this end, we propose an estimator of KL divergence
  which is based on the von Mises expansion. Our closeness test attains optimal parametric
  rates under smoothness assumptions. Equipped with this test, which serves as a building
  block of our causal discovery algorithm to identify the causal structure between
  two multidimensional random variables, we establish sample complexity guarantees
  for our causal discovery method. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the
  first work that provides sample complexity guarantees for distinguishing cause and
  effect in multidimensional non-linear models with non-Gaussian continuous variables
  in the presence of unobserved confounding.
