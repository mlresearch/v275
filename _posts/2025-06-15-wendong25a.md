abstract: We explore the relationship between causality, symmetry, and compression.
  We build on and generalize the known connection between learning and compression
  to a setting where causal models are not identifiable. We propose a framework where
  causality emerges as a  consequence of compressing data across multiple environments.
  We define algorithmic causality as an alternative definition of causality when traditional
  assumptions for causal identifiability do not hold. We demonstrate how algorithmic
  causal and symmetric structures can emerge from minimizing upper bounds on Kolmogorov
  complexity, without knowledge of intervention targets. We hypothesize that these
  insights may also provide a novel perspective on the emergence of causality in machine
  learning models, such as large language models, where causal relationships may not
  be explicitly identifiable.
