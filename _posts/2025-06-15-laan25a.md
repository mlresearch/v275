abstract: Inverse weighting with an estimated propensity score is widely used by estimation
  methods in causal inference to adjust for confounding bias. However, directly inverting
  propensity score estimates can lead to instability, bias, and excessive variability
  due to large inverse weights, especially when treatment overlap is limited. In this
  work, we propose a post-hoc calibration algorithm for inverse propensity weights
  that generates well-calibrated, stabilized weights from user-supplied, cross-fitted
  propensity score estimates. Our approach employs a variant of isotonic regression
  with a loss function specifically tailored to the inverse propensity weights. Through
  theoretical analysis and empirical studies, we demonstrate that isotonic calibration
  improves the performance of doubly robust estimators of the average treatment effect.
