abstract: We explore "omitted label contexts," in which training data is limited to
  a subset of the possible labels. This setting is standard among specialized human
  experts or specific focused studies. By studying Simpson’s paradox, we observe that
  "correct" adjustments sometimes require non-exchangeable treatment and control groups.
  A generalization of Simpson’s paradox leads us to study networks of conclusions
  drawn from different contexts, within which a paradox of nontransitivity arises.
  We prove that the space of possible nontransitive structures in these networks exactly
  corresponds to structures that form from aggregating ranked-choice votes.
