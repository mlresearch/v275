abstract: Convergent Cross Mapping (CCM) is a powerful method for detecting causality
  in coupled nonlinear dynamical systems, providing a model-free approach to capture
  dynamic causal interactions. Partial Cross Mapping (PCM) was introduced as an extension
  of CCM to address indirect causality in three-variable systems by comparing cross-mapping
  quality between direct cause-effect mapping and indirect mapping through an intermediate
  conditioning variable. However, PCM remains limited to univariate delay embeddings
  in its cross-mapping processes. In this work, we extend PCM to the multivariate
  setting, introducing multiPCM, which leverages multivariate embeddings to more effectively
  distinguish indirect causal relationships. We further propose a multivariate cross-mapping
  framework (MXMap) for causal discovery in dynamical systems. This two-phase framework
  combines (1) pairwise CCM tests to establish an initial causal graph and (2) multiPCM
  to refine the graph by pruning indirect causal connections. Through experiments
  on simulated data and the ERA5 Reanalysis weather dataset, we demonstrate the effectiveness
  of MXMap. Additionally, MXMap is compared against several baseline methods, showing
  advantages in accuracy and causal graph refinement.
