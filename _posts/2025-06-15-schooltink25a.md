abstract: 'Causal abstractions allow us to relate causal models on different levels
  of granularity. To ensure that the models agree on cause and effect, frameworks
  for causal abstractions define notions of consistency. Two distinct methods for
  causal abstraction are common in the literature: (i) graphical abstractions, such
  as Cluster DAGs, which relate models on a structural level, and (ii) functional
  abstractions, like $\alpha$-abstractions, which relate models by maps between variables
  and their ranges. In this paper we will align the notions of graphical and functional
  consistency and show an equivalence between the class of Cluster DAGs, consistent
  $\alpha$-abstractions, and constructive $\tau$-abstractions. Furthermore, we extend
  this alignment by introducing more expressive Partial Cluster DAGs. Our results
  provide a rigorous bridge between the functional and graphical frameworks and allow
  for adoption and transfer of results between them.'
