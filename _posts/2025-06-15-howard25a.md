abstract: In this work we aim to bridge the divide between autonomous vehicles and
  causal reasoning. Autonomous vehicles have come to increasingly interact with human
  drivers, and in many cases may pose risks to the physical or mental well-being of
  those they interact with. Meanwhile causal models, despite their inherent transparency
  and ability to offer contrastive explanations, have found limited usage within such
  systems. As such, we first identify the challenges that have limited the integration
  of structural causal models within autonomous vehicles. We then introduce a number
  of theoretical extensions to the structural causal model formalism in order to tackle
  these challenges. This augments these models to possess greater levels of modularisation
  and encapsulation, as well presenting temporal causal model representation with
  constant space complexity. We also prove through the extensions we have introduced
  that dynamically mutable sets (e.g. varying numbers of autonomous vehicles across
  time) can be used within a structural causal model while maintaining a relaxed form
  of causal stationarity. Finally we discuss the application of the extensions in
  the context of the autonomous vehicle and service robotics domain along with potential
  directions for future work.
