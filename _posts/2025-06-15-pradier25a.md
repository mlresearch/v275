abstract: Matching is a popular approach in causal inference to estimate treatment
  effects by pairing treated and control units that are most similar in terms of their
  covariate information. However, classic matching methods completely ignore the geometry
  of the data manifold, which is crucial to define a meaningful distance for matching,
  and struggle when covariates are noisy and high-dimensional. In this work, we propose
  GeoMatching, a matching method to estimate treatment effects that takes into account
  the intrinsic data geometry induced by existing causal mechanisms among the confounding
  variables. First, we learn a low-dimensional, latent Riemannian manifold that accounts
  for uncertainty and geometry of the original input data. Second, we estimate treatment
  effects via matching in the latent space based on the learned latent Riemannian
  metric. We provide theoretical insights and empirical results in synthetic and real-world
  scenarios, demonstrating that GeoMatching yields more effective treatment effect
  estimators, even as we increase input dimensionality, in the presence of outliers,
  or in semi-supervised scenarios.
