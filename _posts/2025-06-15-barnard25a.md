abstract: Adverse drug events (ADEs) cost society lives and an estimated $30 billion
  per year in the USA alone.  Their prevalence has led to the public losing trust
  in the safety of drugs, especially generics (e.g., Eban, 2019).  These concerns
  have motivated the wide study of methods for general ADE discovery, but discovering
  ADEs in generic drugs challenges causal discovery methods with a scenario of multiple
  treatments over time, a scenario which presents new problems and opportunities for
  machine learning.  In response, this research develops methods for causal discovery
  based on analyzing controlled before–After studies with differential prediction
  and temporal inverse probability weighting.  These methods are easy to realize by
  employing off-the-shelf machine learning classifiers.  Experiments on both synthetic
  and real electronic health records demonstrate the ability of the methods to control
  for confounding, discover generic-specific ADEs in synthetic data, and hypothesize
  brand–generic differences in real-world data that agree with known ones.  These
  are the abilities that causal discovery methods need to help establish the facts
  of generic drug safety.
