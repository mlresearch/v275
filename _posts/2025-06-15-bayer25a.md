abstract: Clustering algorithms may unintentionally propagate or intensify existing
  disparities, leading to unfair representations or biased decision-making. Current
  fair clustering methods rely on notions of fairness that do not capture any information
  on the underlying causal mechanisms. We show that optimising for non-causal fairness
  notions can paradoxically induce direct discriminatory effects from a causal standpoint.
  We present a clustering approach that incorporates causal fairness metrics to provide
  a more nuanced approach to fairness in unsupervised learning. Our approach enables
  the specification of the causal fairness metrics that should be minimised. We demonstrate
  the efficacy of our methodology using datasets known to harbour unfair biases.
