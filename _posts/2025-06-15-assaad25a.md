abstract: Understanding causal mechanisms across different populations is essential
  for designing effective public health interventions. Recently, difference graphs
  have been introduced as a tool to visually represent causal variations between two
  distinct populations. While there has been progress in inferring these graphs from
  data through causal discovery methods, there remains a gap in systematically leveraging
  their potential to enhance causal reasoning. This paper addresses that gap by establishing
  conditions for identifying causal changes and effects using difference graphs. It
  specifically focuses on identifying total causal changes and total effects in a
  nonparametric setting, as well as direct causal changes and direct effects in a
  linear setting. In doing so, it provides a novel approach to  causal reasoning that
  holds potential for various public health applications.
