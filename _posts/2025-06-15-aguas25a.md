abstract: We define the Probability of Tiered Benefit in scenarios with a binary exposure  and
  an outcome that is either categorical with $K \geq 2$ ordered tiers or continuous
  partitioned by $K-1$ fixed thresholds into disjoint intervals. Similarly to other
  pure counterfactual queries, this parameter is not $g$-identifiable without additional
  assumptions. We demonstrate that strong monotonicity does not suffice for point
  identification when $K \geq 3$ and provide sharp bounds both with and without such
  constraint. Inference and uncertainty quantification for these bounds are challenging
  tasks due to potential nonregularity induced by ambiguities in the underlying individualized
  optimization problems. Such ambiguities can arise from immunities or null treatment
  effects in subpopulations with positive probability, affecting the lower bound estimate
  and hindering conservative inference. To address these issues, we extend the available
  Stabilized One-Step Correction (S1S) procedure by incorporating stratum-specific
  stabilizing matrices. Through simulations, we illustrate the benefits of this approach
  over existing alternatives. We apply our method to estimate bounds on the probabilities
  of tiered benefit and harm from pharmacological treatment for ADHD upon academic
  achievement, employing observational data from diagnosed Norwegian schoolchildren.
  Our findings indicate that while girls and children with low prior test performance
  could have moderate chances of both benefit and harm from treatment, a clear-cut
  recommendation remains uncertain across all strata.
