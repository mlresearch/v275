abstract: 'Estimating counterfactual outcomes of time-varying treatment types and
  associated dosages is important for addressing medical problems. This task becomes
  more challenging when both the treatment type and dosage assignment are biased due
  to the presence of time-varying confounders,  as compared to estimating outcomes
  for treatment types alone. Specifically, the setup yields the following two obstacles:  first,
  treatment types and dosages are selected sequentially, causing observed outcomes
  to be biased at each time step,  leading to $2 \times \tau$ biases for a $\tau$-step-ahead
  prediction (sequential selection bias);   second, the number of treatment trajectories
  increases exponentially with $\tau$ (combinatorial explosion).  In this paper, we
  introduce Encoder-Decoder Time-SCIGAN (EDTS),  which combines a longitudinal encoder-decoder
  transformer with a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) for estimating counterfactuals.
  The encoder-decoder architecture predicts outcomes for one-step- and multi-step-ahead
  predictions separately,  while the GAN generates counterfactual outcomes that cannot
  be distinguished from observed outcomes by the discriminators to handle sequential
  selection bias. To address combinatorial explosion, we propose a novel discrimination
  method,  Sequential Counterfactual Discrimination (SCD) for EDTS discriminators.
  Our evaluation of synthetic and semi-synthetic datasets demonstrate that EDTS outperforms
  the current baselines.  To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to
  propose an architecture  for estimating counterfactual outcomes of both time-varying
  treatment types and dosages. Implementation is available at \url{https://github.com/ynorimat/EDTS}.'
