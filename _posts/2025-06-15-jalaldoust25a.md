abstract: We consider the problem of causal discovery (a.k.a., causal structure learning)
  in a multi-domain setting. We assume that the causal functions are invariant across
  the domains, while the distribution of the exogenous noise may vary. Under causal
  sufficiency (i.e., no confounders exist), we show that the causal diagram can be
  discovered under less restrictive functional assumptions compared to previous work.
  What enables causal discovery in this setting is bijective generation mechanisms
  (BGM), which ensures that the functional relation between the exogenous noise E
  and the endogenous variable Y is bijective and differentiable in both directions
  at every level of the cause variable X = x. BGM generalizes a variety of models
  including additive noise model, LiNGAM, post-nonlinear model, location-scale noise
  model. Further, we derive a statistical test to find the parents set of the target
  variable. Experiments on various synthetic and real-world datasets validate our
  theoretical findings.
